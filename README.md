# The Writer

The Writer application was developed using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3, in addition to a library of icons used in the interface.

The images are inserted using internet urls, which are arranged in a javascript object that also contains the id and name of each image.

The images are rendered on the screen using a javascript function,
which generates the HTML elements by ordering them based on the information saved by the user or according to the ID.

The colors used in the development were obtained from a color palette available on the website https://coolors.co/faa916-fbfffe-6d676e-1b1b1e-96031a
